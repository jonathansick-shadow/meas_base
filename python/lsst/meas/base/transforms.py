"""Measurement transformations.

When a measurement plugin is run, it provides raw, uncalibrated outputs such
as pixel positions. A transformation may be run as a post-processing step to
convert those outputs to calibrated quantities, such as celestial coordinates.

At construction, the transformation is passed the configuration and name of
the plugin whose outputs it will be transformaing (all fields in the input
table produced by that plugin will have their field names prefixed by the
plugin name) and a `SchemaMapper` which holds the schemata for the input and
output catalogs and which may be used to directly map fields between the
catalogs.

When a transformer is called, it is handed a `SourceCatalog` containing the
measurements to be transformed, a `BaseCatalog` in which to store results, and
information about the WCS and calibration of the data. It may be safely
assumed that both are contiguous in memory, thus a ColumnView may be used for
efficient processing. If the transformation is not possible, it should be
aborted by throwing an exception; if this happens, the caller should
assume that the contents of the output catalog are inconsistent.

Transformations can be defined in Python or in C++. Python code should inherit
from `MeasurementTransform`, following its interface.
