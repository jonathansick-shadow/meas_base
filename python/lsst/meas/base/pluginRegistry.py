            and it should generally contain the name of the Plugin or Algorithm class itself

            For example "base_GaussianFlux" indicates an algorithm in meas_base

        @param[in] apCorrList  list of field name prefixes for flux fields that should be aperture corrected.
            If an algorithm produces a single flux that should be aperture corrected then it is simpler
            to set shouldApCorr=True. But if an algorithm produces multiple such fields then it must
