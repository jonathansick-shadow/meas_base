    """!
    Class that handles replacing sources with noise during measurement.

    When measuring a source (or the children associated with a parent source), this class is used
    to replace its neighbors with noise, using the deblender's definition of the sources as stored
    in HeavyFootprints attached to the SourceRecords.  The algorithm works as follows:
     - We start by replacing all pixels that are in source Footprints with artificially
       generated noise (__init__).
     - When we are about to measure a particular source, we add it back in, by inserting that source's
       HeavyFootprint (from the deblender) into the image.
     - When we are done measuring that source, we again replace the HeavyFootprint with (the same)
       artificial noise.
     - After measuring all sources, we return the image to its original state.

    This is a functional copy of the code in the older ReplaceWithNoiseTask, but with a slightly different
    API needed for the new measurement framework; note that it is not a Task, as the lifetime of a
    NoiseReplacer now corresponds to a single exposure, not an entire processing run.

        determine the deblend families.  This routine should create HeavyFootprints for any non-Heavy
        Footprints, and replace them in the dict.  It should then create a dict of HeavyFootprints
        containing noise, but only for parent objects, then replace all sources with noise.

        and clip those that lie on the border.
